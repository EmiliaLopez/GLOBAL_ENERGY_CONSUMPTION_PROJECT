***GLOBAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION PROJECT***
**`¬°Welcome back! üëãüèº`**

This dataset contains sustainable energy indicators and other useful factors in all countries between 2000 and 2020. Dive into vital aspects such as electricity access, renewable energy, carbon emissions, energy intensity, financial flows and economic growth. I am excited to perform Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, EDA and Modelling. Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy).

Objectives
**Perform an end-to-end analysis** applying statistical or machine learning techniques and present the results.

Prediciton of Primary energy consumption per person (kwh/p)

This exploratory analysis contributes to enhancing our understanding of the role of energy in global energy sustainability. It provides a clear vision of how energy access, energy consumption, and production can impact sustainability and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the 2030 Agenda.

## Challenges
Perform an end-to-end analysis applying statistical or machine learning techniques and present the results.

Ensuring data quality and predictive modelling: it is very important to ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the  data used for analysis as well as developing accurate and reliable models to predict the electric energy consumption per person(kwh/p) with differentnet preproccesed data.

Workflow
**Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, renaming columns, handling inconsistencies in data..
**Data Wrangling**: Filtering rows based on conditions, sorting data, reshaping data, grouping data based on categories..
**EDA**: computing statistics, cratin visualization to explore data, exploring distribution, identifying correlations, detecting patterns and trends in data.
**K- MEANS CLustering**

**Predicting electric energy consumption per person(kwh/p)**: normalized and standardized numerical data,  splitting data into Features, train/Test Split data, transforming data for training a Linear Regression model, train and test models using normalized and standardized numerical data.

**Modelling**:

- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression
- KNN Regression
  
**Summarize results/conclusions.


Technologies
